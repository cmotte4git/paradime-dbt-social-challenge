# YouTube Trending Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing YouTube trending data across 15 countries, leveraging dbt (Data Build Tool) to implement a scalable, efficient data pipeline. The objective is to gain insights into trending videos and their metadata, following best practices like Kimball's methodology and dbt's incremental models for large datasets. The project aligns with dbt‚Äôs design patterns recommended by GitLab.

## Data Sources and Lineage
We use YouTube's API to collect two main datasets via AWS Lambda:

- **YouTube Trending Videos**: Capturing metadata of trending videos across 15 countries.
- **YouTube Categories**: Fetching trending video categories in the same countries.

Both datasets are enriched with additional metadata such as country information and date data for enhanced analytics.

### Data Lineage
1. **Source Tables**:
   - `stg_yt_trending`: Staging table for YouTube trending videos.
   - `stg_yt_category`: Staging table for video categories.

2. **Dimension and Fact Tables**:
   - `dim_category` (SCD Type 2): Tracks historical changes in video categories.
   - `dim_channel` (SCD Type 2): Tracks historical changes in YouTube channel metadata.
   - `dim_country`: Provides country information.
   - `dim_date`: Date dimension for time-based analysis.
   - `fct_yt_trending`: Fact table for YouTube trending videos, including video performance metrics like views, likes, and comments.

3. **Preparation Tables**:
   - `prep_yt_trending`: Prepares the trending videos data for further analysis.
   - `prep_yt_category`: Prepares the video category data.
   - `prep_yt_channel`: Prepares the YouTube channel data.

4. **Mart Layer**:
   - `mart_youtube_trending`: Provides high-level insights into YouTube video trends.

## Methodology

### Kimball's Data Warehouse Approach
We have modeled the data using Kimball‚Äôs approach with dimension and fact tables. Type-2 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD2) are implemented to track historical changes in categories and YouTube channel names.

### Data Transformation Using dbt
- **Staging Models**: Raw data from the YouTube API is loaded into staging tables (`stg_yt_trending`, `stg_yt_category`). Here, we apply light transformations to ensure data quality, such as removing duplicates and handling null values.

- **Preparation Models**: The staging data is further transformed into `prep_yt_trending`, `prep_yt_category`, and `prep_yt_channel`. These models apply more complex logic, including surrogate key generation, ensuring unique identifiers, and joining with date and country dimensions.

- **Incremental Models**: To handle large datasets efficiently, several models, including `prep_yt_trending` and `fct_yt_trending`, use dbt‚Äôs incremental materialization. Incremental models update the warehouse by processing only new or changed data.

#### Sample dbt Incremental Configuration:
```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key=['video_id', 'country_code', 'trending_date']
    )
}}

### SCD Type 2 for Dimensions
For category names and channel metadata, we implemented SCD Type 2 to track historical changes. This allows us to analyze changes over time in:
- **`dim_category`**: Tracks YouTube video categories.
- **`dim_channel`**: Tracks historical changes in YouTube channel information.

### Data Validation
We use dbt tests to maintain data accuracy and quality:
- **Uniqueness Tests**: Ensure primary keys, such as `video_id` and `category_id`, are unique.
- **Foreign Key Tests**: Verify the integrity between fact and dimension tables.
- **Incremental Model Tests**: Validate that the incremental logic is functioning correctly.

### Project Models

#### Dimension Models
- **`dim_category`**: Tracks YouTube video categories using SCD2.
- **`dim_channel`**: Tracks historical changes in YouTube channel metadata with SCD2.
- **`dim_country`**: Static dimension providing metadata on countries.
- **`dim_date`**: Date dimension table for time-related analysis.

#### Fact Table
- **`fct_yt_trending`**: The central fact table that tracks video trending metadata across multiple dimensions, such as country, date, and category.

#### Snapshot Models
- **`dim_channel_snapshot`**: Tracks historical changes in YouTube channel names using SCD2.
- **`dim_category_snapshot`**: Tracks historical changes in YouTube categories using SCD2.


### Data Flow
- **Staging**: Data from the YouTube API is ingested into staging tables (`stg_yt_trending`, `stg_yt_category`).
- **Preparation**: The staging data is processed, cleaned, and joined with dimensions (e.g., `prep_yt_trending`).
- **Fact Table**: The `fct_yt_trending` fact table is built using incremental materialization.
- **Mart Layer**: The final data mart (`mart_youtube_trending`) is used for high-level insights and reporting on YouTube video trends.

### Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
- **AWS Lambda**: For daily API requests and storing data in Parquet format.
- **DuckDB**: For quick, in-memory processing of API data.
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**: For building, transforming, and maintaining the data pipeline.
- **GitLab CI/CD**: To manage the deployment of dbt transformations, following dbt best practices for incremental and full refresh models.
- **Kimball Methodology**: Provides the foundation for designing the data warehouse with dimension and fact tables, ensuring scalability and performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of dbt to process and analyze YouTube trending data at scale. With incremental models, SCD Type 2 snapshots, and automated data ingestion through AWS Lambda, we ensure that both historical and current data are accurately tracked and efficiently transformed for high-quality insights into YouTube trends.
